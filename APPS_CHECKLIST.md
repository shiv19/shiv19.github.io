## üìù Configuration Guide

### Adding New Apps

Edit `_data/apps.yml`:

```yaml
apps:
  - name: "App Name"
    description: "App description"
    url: "https://app.domain.com"
    icon: "material_icon_name"
    category: "category_key"
```

### Adding New Categories

Edit `_data/apps.yml`:

```yaml
categories:
  new_category:
    name: "Display Name"
    color: "tailwind_color"  # blue, green, purple, etc.
```

### Available Material Icons

Common icons: `apps`, `build`, `share`, `lock`, `casino`, `draw`, `reddit`, `child_care`, `directions_run`, `view_kanban`

### Tailwind Colors Available

- `blue`, `green`, `purple`, `gray`, `pink`, `orange`, `indigo`, `red`, `yellow`

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **CORS Restrictions**: Some apps may not respond to status checks due to CORS policies
2. **Favicon Loading**: Some sites may block favicon requests from external domains
3. **Mobile Performance**: Status checking may be slower on mobile networks
4. **Rate Limiting**: Some services may rate limit frequent status checks

## üîß Troubleshooting

### App Shows as Offline But Works

- Check CORS policy of the target app
- Verify the app URL is correct
- Test manually by visiting the app

### Favicon Not Loading

- Check if the app has a favicon.ico file
- Some apps may block external favicon requests
- Material icon fallback will be used automatically

### Slow Status Checking

- Current timeout is 10 seconds
- Can be adjusted in the `fetchWithTimeout` function
- Consider reducing timeout for faster UX
