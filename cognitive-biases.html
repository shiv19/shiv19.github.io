    summary: "We rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered when making decisions. Once an anchor is set, all subsequent judgments are made in relation to it — even if the anchor is arbitrary.",
    example: '"The jacket was originally $500, now $200!" Feels like a deal — even if $200 is still overpriced.',

    tagline: "Your brain is a yes-man for your existing beliefs.",
    summary: "We seek out, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms what we already believe, while ignoring contradicting evidence.",
    example: 'A manager who "knows" an employee is unreliable notices every late arrival but forgets the 20 times they stayed late.',
    antidote: "Actively seek disconfirming evidence. Ask: what would prove me wrong?",

    name: "Dunning-Kruger Effect",
    tagline: "The less you know, the more confident you feel.",
    summary: "People with limited knowledge in a domain overestimate their competence. Conversely, true experts often underestimate themselves because they're aware of how much they don't know.",
    example: "After reading one article about vaccines, someone feels qualified to debate epidemiologists.",

    summary: "We continue investing in something because of prior investments (money, time, effort), even when the rational choice is to cut losses. The sunk costs are gone regardless of future action.",

    summary: "We judge the probability of events by how easily examples come to mind. Vivid, recent, or emotionally charged events feel more likely than they actually are.",
    example: "After seeing a plane crash on the news, people drive instead of fly — despite flying being far safer.",
