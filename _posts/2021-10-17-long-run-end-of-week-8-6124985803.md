## Gear
ASICS Gel-Kayano Lite 2

## Activity Description
New 5k PR! 24:25 😍 this was my first sub 25 minute 5k.

Used 1 energy gel before the run.
GU caffeine free energy gel - strawberry and banana flavor.

Taste wise I liked the GU energy gel more than the Pure ones. GU gels are thicker too.

I did not take a water bottle with me on this run.
