My first run along Tamaki drive!
I really enjoyed running along Tamaki drive, but the other half not so much, as there were many traffic signals which I had to stop running for. I also went off course for a bit after leaving Tamaki drive, next time I'll know this route better. 

And the second half was a bit more hilly than I imagined, so I just choose to run it easy and not try to chase my PR on this course. 

I want to incorporate more hill sessions into my training now, because I felt like a slug on the hills today.
