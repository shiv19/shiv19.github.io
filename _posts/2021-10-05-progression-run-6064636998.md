## Gear
ASICS Gel-Kayano Lite 2

## Activity Description
This will be the 2nd recovery week in the training.

Ran the last 20 minutes at a faster pace.

I used an energy gel for the first time in this run.
It was the Orange juice flavored energy gel by Pure.

Had the gel 5 minutes before the run, with 300ml of water.

During the run I had 500ml of water which had a tea spoon of pink himalayan salt mixed in it.

This energy gel was a pass ✅ had no funny side effects.
I'll be trying out other flavors of energy gels in my upcoming runs.
All the energy gels that I've purchased are caffeine free.
