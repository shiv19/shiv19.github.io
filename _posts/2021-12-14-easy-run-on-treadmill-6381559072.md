## Activity Description
This was my first treadmill workout since I started training.
It is way easier to keep the heart rate low on a treadmill. It is also a bit boring to run on a treadmill. Lots of sweat too ðŸ¥µ
Used my barefoot shoes for this run.
The distance and pace on the treadmill is in miles.

Looks like Garmin has some treadmill specific badges to collect.
