I revived this classic old game using code skulptor

<p>BattleShip is a simple game where the player gets to find and sink all 3 battleships of his/her opponent. This game depends on the luck of the player as it is purely a guessing game.
    <!--more-->The player can choose to play against the AI or against another player. Or the bonus AI options that I've provided. First the player places 3 battleships on the 5x5 game board. The he/she tries to guess the location of the battleships of the opponent in a turn based manner.</p>
<p>This game was built using SimpleGUI module available in the <a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/" target="_blank">Codeskulptor</a> python. I initially had built a console version of this game while taking a course in <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. Later I learnt to make GUI based programs using SimpleGUI while taking a course named <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython1" target="_blank">Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</a> by <a href="http://www.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice University</a> at <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a>.</p>
<p>You can view the source code of the game by viewing the page source of the game page.</p>
