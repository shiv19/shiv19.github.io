## Gear
ASICS Gel-Kayano Lite 2

## Activity Description
Unfortunately my watch which was tracking this run, ran out of battery. And my earphones died on me too. This run was actually 10.24km long.
I'll add another manual activity for the rest of the run.

The major part of the run was the tempo intervals which was at my race pace. That part was tracked fully here.

The part that wasn't tracked was at a easy pace.
