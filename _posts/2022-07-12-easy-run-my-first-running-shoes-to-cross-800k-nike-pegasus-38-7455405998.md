## Gear
Nike Pegasus 38

## Activity Description
These shoes felt a bit flat at the start of the run, I was feeling a slight pain in the calf of my left leg so I started off at a slow pace.
As the run progressed I felt better and my pace naturally settled closer to 5:00 m/km pace.
These are my first pair of shoes to cross 800k, looking at the tread there's still quite a bit of rubber left. I'm surprised by how long these shoes last.
