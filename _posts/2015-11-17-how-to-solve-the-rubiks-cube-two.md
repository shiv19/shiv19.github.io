Solve that Middle Layer!

<p>This post will guide you through the Step Two in How to Solve the Rubiks Cube.
    If you are here after reading the Step One then please read along. Else <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube/">CLICK HERE</a> to goto Step One. Assuming you mastered Step One, you should now be able solve the First Layer of the cube. Now your cube should look something like this:
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rb2/After-Step-One.png"><br/><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-123" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rb2/After-Step-One.png" alt="After Step One" width="226" height="236" /><br/></a> Now let's move on to the next step on How to Solve the Rubiks Cube.</p>
<h1>STEP 2: Middle Layer</h1>
<p>  <br/><img class="aligncenter wp-image-127 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rb2/Goal1.png" alt="Goal - Step two" width="281" height="289" /><br/></p>
<h5>Holding your cube:</h5>
<p>In this step, you have the hold the cube such that the white layer that you solved, is at the bottom (the top center will be yellow). The front face could be either Red center or Blue or Green or Orange center.</p>
<h5>Things that you need to know about the middle layer:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The middle layer contains 4 center pieces. (Red, Blue, Orange, Green).</li>
    <li>It contains 4 edge pieces.
        <ul>
            <li>A Blue-Red Edge</li>
            <li>A Blue-Orange Edge</li>
            <li>A Green-Red Edge</li>
            <li>A Green-Orange Edge</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>And by reading the basics you already know that the <strong>Center Pieces DO NOT MOVE, </strong>this means that the center pieces are already solved. We just have to solve those 4 edge pieces. yay! :D</p>
<h5>Matching the case:</h5>
<p>Make sure that you are holding the cube with yellow on top and white at the bottom, now find an <strong>Edge Piece </strong>at the top layer which <strong>does not</strong> have <strong>Yellow. </strong>I.e., it should be any one of the piece listed above. Now keeping that edge piece in your front view, see the color on the front face, let's say it is Blue (it can be Blue or Red or Green or Orange), now by rotating the Up layer, make that front facing Blue match the Blue center (it can be Blue or Red or Green or Orange respectively) . With that done, now see the top facing color of that edge piece,</p>
<p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Let's say it is Red. Next see which side does the piece have to go to make it solved, in our case, the Red center is to our right so this edge piece has to goto the right side of the middle layer. Just follow the algorithm below to put the piece to the right side of the middle layer. <br/><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-128" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rb2/Right-Side-Case.png" alt="Right Side Case" width="193" height="212" /><br/> Note: Make sure that you match the case before applying the algorithm. Never rotate the cube while applying the algorithm. <strong>General Algorithm to Make an Edge Piece on the Top Layer to goto the Right Side of the Middle Layer:</strong></p>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rb2/Right-Side.png"><br/><img class="wp-image-129" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rb2/Right-Side-300x60.png" alt="U R Ui Ri Ui Fi U F" width="500" height="100" /></a><br/> U R Ui Ri Ui Fi U F<br/>
<p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Let's say it is Orange. Next see which side does the piece have to go to make it solved, in our case, the Orange center is to our left so this edge piece has to goto the left side of the middle layer. Just follow the algorithm below to put the piece to the left side of the middle layer. <br/><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rb2/Left-Side-Case.png" alt="Left Side Case" width="193" height="212" /><br/> Note: Make sure that you match the case before applying the algorithm. Never rotate the cube while applying the algorithm. Also note that this is simply a mirror algorithm to the previous algorithm. <strong>General Algorithm to Make an Edge Piece on the Top Layer to goto the Left Side of the Middle Layer:</strong></p><br/>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rb2/Left-Side.png"><br/><img class="wp-image-131" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rb2/Left-Side-300x59.png" alt="Ui Li U L U F Ui Fi" width="509" height="100" /></a><br/> Ui Li U L U F Ui Fi<br/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Important NOTE:</h5>
<p><strong>If one of the edge pieces is already in the middle row, but in the wrong position, then do either one of the sequential moves, and it will move to the top layer. Then you can do the appropriate sequential moves to position it in the correct location of the middle layer.</strong>  </p>
<p>If you have carefully followed the above steps, you should be able to solve the middle layer. If you have done so, then you are ready to move to the next step.</p>
<p>However, if you are facing any difficulty, you can refer to my video tutorial which covers the same thing.</p>
