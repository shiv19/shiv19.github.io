## Gear
ASICS Gel-Kayano Lite 2

## Activity Description
This was supposed to be a long run. But at 3km mark, I got a bad stomach cramp, so I decided to abandon it.
I think I didn't wait long enough after having breakfast. Lesson learnt, shouldn't have experimented with pre-race meal today. 
Should have rather run on an empty stomach.
I'll attempt this course again later today.
