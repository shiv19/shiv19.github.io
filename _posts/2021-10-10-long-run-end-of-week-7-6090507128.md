ASICS Gel-Kayano Lite 2

## Activity Description
Damn, I thought this would be my first sub 2hr half marathon. Didn't see the distance before stopping the activity 🤦‍♂️
Ran another 1k after this separately.

Realized that this was only short of 190 meters to a half marathon. 
Which means I just have to add 1 minute 1 second to this run based on my 1k run after this. 

So that brings it to 1:57:20! 😍😍
This is my first sub 2hr half marathon. 
Feeling fantastic! 😃 

Which means I already ran a sub 2hr half marathon!  

I used 2 energy gels in this run, and 500 ml of water.

First energy gel at 40min mark, 2nd at 1hr 30min mark.

No energy gel before the run.

Looking back, I feel there were definitely sections where I could have avoided the walking breaks,

I was following the pace pro strategy on this course, I was more than 1 minute ahead of time.
Just did not know that it would end up showing 20.09 as the distance.
The course distance is 21.09.
