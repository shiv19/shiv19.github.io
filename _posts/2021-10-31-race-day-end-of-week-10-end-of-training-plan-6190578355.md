So happy to reap the reward for all the training I went through! 1:55:27! New PR ðŸ¤©
My training plan was for 5:36/km pace. But I managed to pull off a 5:28/km avg pace today. Feeling great now.

Unlike my morning run today, there was no sign of stomach cramps. Because I waited a good 5 hours after lunch.

Used 2 GU energy gels. One at 8km mark and another around 15km.
Strawberry banana flavor.
