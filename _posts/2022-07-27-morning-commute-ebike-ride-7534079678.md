## Gear
Trek Powerfly 5

## Activity Description
I've sprained my upper back at the gym yesterday. My sleep broke at 4am, and I couldn't sleep after that.
Couldn't get up straight, had to roll over.
Went to the spa and sauna this morning and did some stretches and foam rolling. My back mobility improved, but it isn't still feeling good enough to run.
