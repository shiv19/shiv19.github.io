This was supposed to be an easy run. But I was feeling very good today so pushed the pace on. My LTHR changed to 176 after this run! I ran the same path 4 months ago with a time of 1hr 18m with a few walks and huffing and puffing. Today I finished strong and didn't even sweat much.
I can feel my fitness improving. ðŸ’ª
