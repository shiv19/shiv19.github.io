## Gear
ASICS Gel-Kayano Lite 2

## Activity Description
What I learnt about chest mount heart rate monitor today is that if you don't wear it tight enough that it doesn't slip when you deep breathe out, expect it to slip during high intensity runs.

I had mine slip down once during the last phase of Lactate threshold guided test run and twice during fartlek run 🤦‍♂️

Will be wearing it tighter next time.
