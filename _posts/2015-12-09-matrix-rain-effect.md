<h4>So let's get started with it. These are the things that you'll need:</h4><ul><li>Text Editor (Notepad, WordPad, etc)</li><li>Command Prompt</li></ul><h1>Step 1:</h1><ul><li><h2>Open Notepad</h2></li><li><h2>Start off by typing the following code</h2></li></ul><blockquote><p>@echo off <br />color 02 <br />mode 1000 <br />cls <br />:start</p></blockquote><h3>Explanation:</h3><p><strong>@echo off :</strong> This turns off displaying of the path of the current directory in command prompt.</p><p><br /><strong>color 02     :</strong> This makes the background color black, and the text color green in command prompt. For a full list of available colors, you can goto command prompt and type <code>color ?</code> and hit Enter. Below is a list of available colors,<br />0 = Black 8 = Gray<br />1 = Blue 9 = Light Blue <br />2 = Green A = Light Green<br />3 = Aqua B = Light Aqua<br />4 = Red C = Light Red<br />5 = Purple D = Light Purple<br />6 = Yellow E = Light Yellow<br />7 = White F = Bright White</p><p><strong>mode 1000: </strong>This makes the command prompt window appear as big as possible on your screen.</p><p><strong>cls               :  </strong>This clears the command prompt screen.</p><p><strong>:start         </strong> <strong>:   </strong>This is a label, you can replace "start" with your name if you want.</p><ul><li><h2>Here comes the actual printing part, on the next line type</h2></li></ul><blockquote><p>echo %random%</p></blockquote><p>Press the Tab key on your keyboard, now while holding the keys Ctrl, Shift press the Left Arrow Key on your keyboard 2 times. This should select the "Tab" spacing and "%random%". <br />Hit Ctrl + C on your keyboard once.<br />Now press and hold Ctrl + V on your keyboard for about 5 seconds and then press Enter.<br /><strong>Finally type</strong></p><blockquote><p>goto start</p></blockquote><h3>Explanation:</h3><p><strong>echo %random% :</strong> This will print a random number on the screen. And since we want to print a lot of random numbers on the screen, I asked you to paste so many copies of it. We used a Tab spacing to make it look indented while it prints on the screen.</p><p><strong>goto start           : </strong>This will restart the process, in other words, it will loop back to the place where we typed the "start" label.<br />Note: If u used your own word when we typed the label earlier, then u must replace the "start" with that word here.</p><ul><li><h2>Saving the file (Ctrl+S)</h2></li></ul><p><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>Save the file with the extension <strong>.bat </strong><br />For example, I saved my file as <strong>"Matrix.bat"</strong> on my desktop, you can use your own name followed by <strong>.bat</strong></p><h1>Step 2:</h1><ul><li><h2>Run the program by double clicking on it</h2></li></ul><p>Navigate to the place where you saved the file and double click on it to open the program.</p><h2>Enjoy! :D</h2><ul><li><h2>Closing the program</h2></li></ul><p>To close the program, press Ctrl+C in command prompt and press "y" to stop the execution.</p><h3>Got any Doubts or Comments, leave it in the comment section down below<br />Play around with that echo command and feel free to comment your own version of the Matrix Rain effect.</h3>
