Felt really good during this run. No pain in my legs, this is a run to remember.
My HRV was pretty good today, so that was a good indicator before the run that this workout will be a piece of cake.

Last time I did the same progression run, I couldn't keep that pace for 10mins despite taking energy gel.
But today, I did it without having to carry energy gel or water.
