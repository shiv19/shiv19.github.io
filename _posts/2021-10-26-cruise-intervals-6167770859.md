## Gear
ASICS Gel-Kayano Lite 2

## Activity Description
This is the week 10 and the last week of my training plan. I'll be treating the next Sunday as race day. And will start a different training plan next week :) 

Today I tried out the last energy gel I wanted to try.
Sis Isotonic lemon and lime.

After trying all the energy gels available near me, I think I like the GU Strawberry banana flavored energy gel the most.
So I'll be using that for race day.
