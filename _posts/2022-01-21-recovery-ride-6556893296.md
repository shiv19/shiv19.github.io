## Gear
Trek Powerfly 5

## Activity Description
Here's a recovery tip from me,
Bike rides are great for a runner's recovery.
While riding downhill, I stretch my calf muscles like I've shown in the image attached to this activity.
Be sure to stretch only on the side of your leg that is away from the curve if you're riding down a curve road :)

With this activity, I'm concluding my half marathon training for a goal time of 1:44

Next up is race day on Sunday!
