## Gear
ASICS Gel-Kayano Lite 2

## Activity Description
This was supposed to be a 40 min easy run in Z2. But at 37min when the podcast I was listening to ended, I said, "Ok google play queen on Spotify", it started off with Bohemian Rhapsody. I went like, now I can't stop for another 6 minutes.
Before I knew, that 6 minutes turned into another 40 minutes.
I did not use energy gel for this run,
But I guess some music can give you the same type of energy that an energy gel can 🤫 😂

Also, I didn't pay much attention to my watch today, instead I ran at what pace felt easy for me for certain sections of the run so the heart rate zones are a bit all over the pace.
