## Gear
Saucony Endorphin Speed 2

## Activity Description
Finally hit a 120km week ðŸ˜ƒðŸ™Œ
I'm pleased that I could safely hit this mileage with workouts and tempo runs.
I'm not gonna work towards hitting 160 for AKL marathon training. I'll try it after the marathon.
For now I have decided that it is better for me to focus on quality workouts than focusing on mileage.
RIP to Relative Effort this week ðŸ˜‚
