## Gear
ASICS Gel-Kayano Lite 2

## Activity Description
For the first 45 minutes, I tried my best to keep my HR between Z2 and Z3.
It was getting ridiculous and way too easy, even when I ran at 7:30/km pace the HR monitor was hitting Z5.
I took off my watch and poured water over the HR sensor. It was recording better after that. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

I've decided that until I get my chest strap HR monitor I'm going to ignore zone training. It is just not very reliable. (I've ordered a HRM Pro from garmin). Will be finding out my LTHR and my correct HR zones soon.

I also just realized that my garmin HR zones are different than the one that strava shows. I'll change my garmin zones to match strava for now.
