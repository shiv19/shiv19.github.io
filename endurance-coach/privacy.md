# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** February 16, 2026
**Last updated:** February 16, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Endurance Coach Mobile ("the App", "we", "us", "our") handles your information.

Owner/Publisher: **Shiv19 Labs**
Contact: **sp@shiv19.com**

By using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Summary

- The App is **local-first**: your training data, chat history, and settings are stored on your device.
- The App does **not** run a developer-hosted backend for normal app operation.
- You may optionally connect:
  - Your own AI provider account/API key (BYOK model)
  - Your own Strava app credentials/account
- When connected, relevant data is sent directly from your device to those third-party services.
- You can export backups, import backups, clear chat history, or wipe all local data at any time.

## 2. Information We Process

Depending on features you use, the App may process:

### A. Information you enter

- Chat messages and prompts
- Optional image attachments sent in chat
- Plan details, goals, and athlete context notes
- Post-workout interview responses and reflections
- Settings and preferences (for example, selected coach persona)

### B. Fitness and activity data

If you connect Strava, the App imports activity data such as:

- Activity metadata (type, distance, time, elevation)
- Performance metrics (heart rate, pace/speed, power, cadence, calories, effort/load fields)
- Activity text fields (for example, activity names/descriptions)
- Athlete profile fields returned by Strava (for example, first/last name and selected profile fields)

### C. Credentials and sensitive settings

- AI provider API keys and provider configuration
- Strava OAuth tokens and Strava app credentials

These are stored using encrypted/secure device storage provided by the operating system (via Expo SecureStore).

### D. Diagnostics and support data

If you choose to export debug info and share it with support, the exported file may include app version, configuration state, aggregate database counts, and error/debug log entries. It is designed to exclude API keys and tokens.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use information to:

- Provide AI coaching chat responses
- Generate and manage training plans
- Sync and analyze workouts and training trends
- Support post-workout interview features
- Enable backup/import and troubleshooting flows
- Maintain app reliability and fix issues

## 4. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not sell your personal information.

Data may be shared in these cases:

### A. AI provider you configure (BYOK)

When you chat, relevant message content (and optional attachments you send) is transmitted to the AI provider you selected in settings. Billing and data handling for those requests are governed by that provider's terms and privacy policy.

### B. Strava (optional)

If you connect Strava, the App exchanges OAuth tokens and requests activity/profile data from Strava APIs.

### C. App platform providers

If you buy the App through Apple App Store or Google Play, payment processing is handled by those stores. We do not receive your full payment card details from store transactions.

### D. Support communications you initiate

If you email support or share exports with us, we process the information you send to troubleshoot your request.

## 5. Data Storage and Retention

- Primary app data is stored locally on your device.
- We retain local data until you delete it (for example by clearing chat history, removing connected credentials, wiping all data, uninstalling the app, or overwriting data via import).
- Backup files you export are under your control and may contain sensitive data, especially if you choose "Include Secrets". Store and share backups carefully.

## 6. Security

We use reasonable technical measures, including platform secure storage for sensitive credentials/tokens and local database storage for app data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and you are responsible for securing your device and exported files.

## 7. Your Choices and Controls

Inside the App, you can:

- Use the App without Strava (optional integration)
- Add/remove AI provider profiles and API keys
- Connect/disconnect Strava and clear saved Strava settings
- Export/import backups
- Delete chat threads or clear all chat history
- Wipe all local data

To request privacy-related support, contact: **sp@shiv19.com**

## 8. International Data Transfers

When you use third-party AI providers or Strava, your information may be processed in countries outside your own. Processing locations depend on the providers you choose.

## 9. Children's Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children through a developer-operated backend.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updated versions will be posted in-app or through app listing updates with a revised "Last updated" date.
